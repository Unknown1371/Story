I'm waking up to pink skies up above,
Its like the sky was decorated, its beloved.
Its gives me that feeling of warmth that I love,
And yet I still hope for the next colour change to get a hold of.

The eyes reveal the beauty of creation,
One day I'll see things that would set expectations.
Your eyes define those lights and coloured streaks and lines
Striding the horizon at their peaked golden times.
