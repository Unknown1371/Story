Another day I'll see that red and orange hue shelter the open sky,
Its like when an umbrella covers from above.
You'll see the translucent tint it casts through,
To the other side I see crimson and shades of umbrella blue.

Then one day it'll change to a lilac tone,
The tincture it spreads across from a growing cyclone.
The lightnings ready to shock the skies,
We watch the phenomena as it leaves its trail we arise.
