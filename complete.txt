I reach the conclusion that I can see a million different colours and shades,
All of which I first saw when I came into this world as nothing but a babe.
There are such marvels we can witness of the earth and space we see displayed,
No man-made instrument could ever justify these creations and claim them as an accolade.

And so I leave you with these few lines to end with a blast of a rainbow flavour,
Its special enough to see such spectacular events.
You're all stars reading this so make sure to savour,
Appreciate everything in this world in all its segments and the greater.
