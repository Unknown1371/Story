Once again on a summers eve,
I look up to be shown a vast blue sea.
A few dotted clouds as far as the eye could see,
Nothing but the deep blue shows me a blissful greet.

I could cover the entire spectrum with the colours it offers,
But that can't be given justice with the Northern lights to the east.
The aurora sways like a harmonious visual treat,
My words can never explain the charm of this feat.
